    The only typeface used contributes to the monotone aesthetic of the website and branding. The slight rounded corners on the sans-serif letters give an inviting feel and new trend.

    This font is capable of become a bold statement for headers while also being a nice and readable body copy.
colors:
  primary: The primary colours are all shades darker of the lightest tone. To keep the focus on the artwork, the colours are relaxing and neutral nude tones. They should all be used in contrast with each other depending on the background. Headers are always darker than body copy unless the background is primary-medium.
