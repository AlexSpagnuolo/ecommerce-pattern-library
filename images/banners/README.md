home-banner: |
  The home header is used on most pages. It only features the colour block and the titles.
product-header: |
  The product banner is like the home header except it has the name of the piece and some quick information about it. An image is included in the banner which gives a bolder vibe to the artwork.

The banners are used for titles at the top of each page. The only images on the site are for the artwork, so, instead a solid colour is used for the background.
